Here's the process to create a new MERN-Stack project that starts with the infrastructure code:

Clone the mern-infrastructure repo: git clone <url of mern-infrastructure> <name-of-project>

Note that the folder created will be same as <name-of-project>instead of mern-infrastructure

cd <name-of-project>
Install the Node modules: npm i
Create a .env (touch .env) and add entries for DATABASE_URLand SECRET
Update the "name": "mern-infrastructure"in package.json to the name of your project.
Create a new repo on your personal GH account.
Copy the new GH repo's URL.
Update the remote's URL: git remote set-url origin <paste the copied GH url>
Push for the first time: git push -u origin main
Have fun coding your new project and don't forget to make frequent commits!




This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
